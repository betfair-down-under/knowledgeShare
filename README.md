## Helper functions

### Splitting gallops & harness markets
Unfortunately there is no clean way to separate out gallops and harness markets via the Exchange APIs for ANZ races, expect by matching on the market name and searching for `pace` and `trot`.

An example of a function to return the market type:

``` typescript
// language: typescript
// return true if name includes trot or pace, otherwise false
function isHarness(name: string): boolean {
    name = name.toLowerCase();
    return name.indexOf(" trot") !== -1 || name.indexOf(" pace") !== -1;
}
```

### Race type
The same logic as above applies to identifying race type. Example race types include mdn for a Maiden, hcap for a Handicap, grp1 for Group1.

``` typescript
// language: typescript
// return true if name includes Mdn otherwise false
function isMaiden(name: string): boolean {
    name = name.toLowerCase();
    return name.indexOf(" mdn") !== -1;
}
```

### Race length 
Equally, this is how you can identify race length.

``` typescript
// language: typescript
// takes in market name and returns race length 
function raceLen(name: string): number {
    // # return race length
    // # input samples: 
    // # 'R6 1400m Grp1' -> ('R6','1400m','grp1')
    // # 'R1 1609m Trot M' -> ('R1', '1609m', 'trot')
    // # 'R4 1660m Pace M' -> ('R4', '1660m', 'pace')
    var parts = name.split(' ');
    var race_len = parts[1];
    var x = race_len.split('m');
    var y: number = +x[0];

    console.log("raceLen", name, x, y)

    return y;
}
```

## Pricing logic

### Available to back order
Often you want to look at the 'market favourite' in a race, which can be defined as the runner with the shorted best available to back price.

``` typescript
// language: typescript
// returns sorted order of selections based on best atb price
function AtbOrder(sels: Selection[]): number[]  {
    const sorted = [ ...sels ].sort( (a, b) => {
        if (a.status == SelStatus.Active && b.status != SelStatus.Active) {
            return -1;
        } else if (a.status != SelStatus.Active && b.status == SelStatus.Active) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            const ai = a.lay[0]?.price, bi = b.lay[0]?.price;
            return (ai ?? 1000) - (bi ?? 1000);
        }
    });
    const out = sels.map( s1 => sorted.findIndex( s2 => s1.id == s2.id ));
    return out;
}
```

### Weighted average price (WAP)
Weighted average price is a good way of removing outlier prices and looking at the market more holistically.

#### Best available to lay WAP

``` typescript
// language: typescript
// calculating wap across top three available to lay boxes
function atlWap(atl0, atl1, atl2): number {
    const vol = atl0?.volume + atl1?.volume + atl2?.volume;
    const priceXvol = (atl0?.volume * atl0?.price) + (atl1?.volume * atl1?.price) + (atl2?.volume * atl2?.price)

    return priceXvol/vol;
}
```

#### Best available to back WAP

``` typescript
// language: typescript
// calculating wap across top three available to back boxes
function atbWap(atb0, atb1, atb2): number {
    const vol = atb0?.volume + atb1?.volume + atb2?.volume;
    const priceXvol = (atb0?.volume * atb0?.price) + (atb1?.volume * atb1?.price) + (atb2?.volume * atb2?.price)

    return priceXvol/vol;
}
```

## Staking logic

### Kelly staking
This is an approach to creating Kelly staking functions for back and lay stakes. 

#### Back Kelly

``` typescript
// language: typescript
/**
 * Kelly staking backing
 * http://www.aussportsbetting.com/2010/07/18/kelly-criterion-backing-andlaying-bets-with-betfair/
 * f = p(d-1)(1-c)-q 
        /(d-1)(1-c)
 * f = the fraction of your bankroll (account balance) to bet on a particular outcome of a sporting event
 * d = decimal betting odds for that outcome 
 * p = probability of success (1/rating) 
 * q = probability of failure (1-P)
 * c = commission rate
 * kellyApp: 1 = full, 2 = half, 4 = quarter
 **/
function kellyMultBack(price: number, rating: number, kellyApp: number = 1, commRate: number = 0): number {
    const d = price;
    const c = commRate;
    const p = 1 / rating;
    const q = 1 - p;

    return ((p * (d - 1) * (1 - c) - q) / ((d - 1) * (1 - c))) / kellyApp;
}
```

#### Lay Kelly

``` typescript
// language: typescript
/**
 * Kelly staking laying
 * http://www.aussportsbetting.com/2010/07/18/kelly-criterion-backing-andlaying-bets-with-betfair/
 * f = (q*(1-c)-p*(d-1))
 *      /((d-1)*(1-c)
 * f = the fraction of your bankroll (account balance) to bet on a particular outcome of a sporting event
 * d = decimal betting odds for that outcome 
 * p = probability of success (1/rating) 
 * q = probability of failure (1-P)
 * c = commission rate
 * kellyApp: 1 = full, 2 = half, 4 = quarter
 **/
function kellyMultLay(price: number, rating: number, kellyApp: number = 1, commRate: number = 0): number {
    const d = price;
    const c = commRate;
    const p = 1 / rating;
    const q = 1 - p;

    return ((q * (1 - c) - p * (d - 1)) / ((d - 1) * (1 - c))) / kellyApp;
}
```

## Best practice

### Market start time
Racing markets notoriously go in play later, and/or their start time get pushed back without necessarily being updated on the Betfair API. 

One way of guarding against this is to include a back market percentage check, to use the wisdom of the crowd to inform your betting decisions. i.e. you might check that it's < 30 seconds to the scheduled market start time AND that the BMP < 103%.

BMP is calculated as the sum of (100 / best available to back odds) for all selections in the market.

In a two horse race where both selections were $2 it would be:
`(100/2) + (100/2) = 100%`

### Delayed Races

Occassionaly races will be delayed due to any random reason such as a jockey fall, ambulance not available or kangaroos on the track. If you only get all the markets once a day you may have the wrong start time for a race is a delay happens.  To alleviate from this you can reload the markets every 20 mins and you will catch any market delays as the time will have been updated.  Alternatively use the BMP < 103% method explained under "Market Start Time". 

### Be careful of the market percentage for markets you bet into
A tip to help minimise any disadvantage you may face with a market which is not formed is to not bet into a market where BMP is more than 105%.  If you are going to bet into these markets then ensure you are not taking the current price available and look to set a limit for your price.  

### Understanding your Betfair Starting Price (BSP) Options
There are a few options when it comes to placing a bet with the Betfair SP.  These include MARKET_ON_CLOSE, LIMIT_ON_CLOSE and LAPSE.
- MARKET_ON_CLOSE will take whatever price is available at Betfair SP when the market goes in play.
- LIMIT_ON_CLOSE allows you to set a minimum price you will accept when backing and a maximum price you will accept when laying.  You can not set a maximum when backing or a minimimum when laying as this is counter-intuitive to value.
- LAPSE will not be cancelled when a market goes in play if it has not been matched.  

### Use customerOrderRef when placing bets
Use customerOrderRef to keep track of your bets from different models. It can be set when placing a bet through the API.
